# Tiny861Poker

PIC 16F628 poker, rewritten in C for AVR attiny861 chip.

I've included the .cproj file from old Atmel Studio version in case anyone wants to try that - I was unable to get it to work with MPLAB-X but the Makefile is for avr-gcc.

I also wanted to use my old AVR Dragon, which MPLAB-X doesn't appear to support. I'm going to write a version of this for Arduino soon anyway, I believe (the C version might be a good jumping-off point for an arduino version.)

***not yet tested in hardware.**
